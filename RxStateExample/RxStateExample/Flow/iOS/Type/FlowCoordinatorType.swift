/**
Flow Coordinator is an Action Creator. However, Flow Coordinator can dispatchers the Actions it generate itself instead of delevering them to the View Model using the Mixin function `navigate(_)` which retunes a `Driver<Void>` that only sends `.completed`.
 
 Notes:
    1- Make sure `Driver<Action>` returned by the `create(_)` function always completes.
 
    2- We can't use the dispose bag of the view/view controller to dispose of `Driver<ActionType>` returned from the `create(_)` function because the subscription should out live the view/view controller that "trigged" them: The `transissionedToRoute` Action should be dispatched after the flow transission is finished -> After the view/view controller triggered the tranission is dinitiated -> After thier dispose bag is emptied.
